# Anti-lag Sheep

Allow sheep to give more wool over time. Sheep will slowly gain experience, giving more wool each time you shear them. However, sheep only gain experience if there are fewer than three in an area. This is a data pack, not a mod, so you can include it in any vanilla world. Data packs can only be used with the Java Edition of Minecraft.

# How to Use

Shear the sheep!

If there are only one or two sheep of each color, those sheep will slowly level up over time. The sheep don't indicate their level, but will give more wool each time they are sheared as they level up. If there are four or more sheep of the same color, those sheep will lose levels over time, reverting to vanilla behavior.

Two sheep farms will not interfere with each other as long as they are more than 500 blocks apart. If they are closer than that, they still won't interfere as long as only one is loaded at a time.

# Multiplayer

This data pack should be compatible with multiplayer worlds, but has only been tested in single-player.

You'll need to place the data pack .zip file in the world's *datapacks* folder. You don't need to extract the .zip file. Once that's done, the data pack should activate automatically the next time you open the world in Minecraft.

If the data pack does not activate automatically. You can activate it manually using the [/datapack](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands/datapack) command like so: `/datapack enable "file/AntiLagSheep.zip"`.

On the *Create New World* screen, click the *Data Packs*. You can drag the data pack .zip file onto the Minecraft window or click *Open Pack Folder* to open a temporary folder to copy it into. Once the file is available in Minecraft, you'll need to hover your mouse over the data pack and click the arrow to move it from *Available* to *Selected*.

# Removing the Data Pack

It is safe to remove the data pack at a later time. You can delete the .zip file from your world while the world is not open in Minecraft or disable it in the game using the command, `/datapack disable "file/AntiLagSheep.zip"`. If you are in a single-player world and don't have permission to use the command, you can temporarily grant yourself permission by pausing the game, selecting *Open to LAN*, switching *Allow Cheats* to ON, and clicking *Start LAN World*.

If you remove the data pack from a world, all sheep will revert to their usual behavior. The sheep will resume giving more wool if the pack is re-added and will resume at whatever level they had when the pack was deactivated.
